<h1>GREENRECIPES: React/Hooks/MATERIAL-UI/Public REST API</h1>

React crud web app that allows adding, saving and deleting lists of foods based on the macronutrients they provide.
The app takes then a food combination from the saved food list as a search query, and sends a get request to a public Recipe Search API.
The app also features adding details to recipes (eg: Peanut-Free, Sugar-Free, Alcohol-Free) in a placeholder.
All the recipes are filtered and 100% vegan.
